# Welcome

This blog is powered by simple markdown files served from the public folder. You can write posts with headings, paragraphs, **bold**, *italic*, `inline code`, and links like [Spline](https://spline.design).

## Why this setup?

- Fast to iterate
- Easy to version
- Works great for portfolios and personal sites

### Get started

Create a new entry in `public/posts/index.json` and a matching `.md` file next to it.
